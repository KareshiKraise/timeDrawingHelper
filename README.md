# timeDrawingHelper
Utility for timed drawing with a single monitor. 


If you have a single monitor, you may be bothered by the fact that its troublesome to resize your window to accomodate for your digital drawing software and the reference images at the same time.
For this reason I developed this small application to help me practice drawing.

It is programmed to be always on top of any other window and update images on a timer.

## Usage
1. Point the application where to search for your images (at the moment, only png and jpeg): Go to Settings > Set images folder 
2. Select how many seconds per image you want to draw in the spinbox (maximum of 600 seconds, or 10 minutes).
3. click start

The application will select a new image at random every N seconds for you. 

## Known bugs and problems:
1. Resizing the window is still not handled. 
2. Misplaced text when no folder is selected.
